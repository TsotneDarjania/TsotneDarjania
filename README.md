## üñ•Ô∏è **What I Build**

### Full-Stack Web Development
My main focus is on building **scalable**, **maintainable**, and **efficient** full-stack applications using modern frameworks like **React**, **Next.js**, **Solid.js**, and backend technologies like **Node.js** and **Express**. I believe that a well-built app is one that can grow with the user‚Äôs needs while maintaining a high standard of performance.

### Browser-Based Game Development
I love working on **interactive browser-based games**. Using **Phaser.js** and **Three.js**, I build experiences that are engaging and visually immersive. Whether it's 2D or 3D, I focus on crafting games that players want to come back to.

### Data Analysis
Data is powerful when used right. I like diving into **data analysis** to extract meaningful insights, whether for personal projects or professional ones. I work on projects that involve making sense of large datasets and building tools to visualize and understand data.

## üß† **My Core Approach**

I believe in keeping things straightforward. Instead of chasing every new trend, I focus on building things that work well and stand the test of time. Writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code is my priority. Technology, for me, is about solving real problems and making systems that people can rely on.

I like taking a thoughtful, balanced approach to development. It's not about using the fanciest tools, but about understanding how each piece fits together and making smart decisions that lead to scalable, functional solutions. Whether it's a web app, a game, or working with data, I aim to create something solid, practical, and built to last.
